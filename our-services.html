														<h4>Mutual Funds</h4>
														<p>Mutual fund is a trust that pools money from a group of investors
															(sharing common financial goals) and invest the money thus
															collected into asset classes that match the stated investment
															objectives of the scheme. Since the stated investment objectives
															of a mutual fund scheme generally forms the basis for an
															investor’s decision to contribute money to the pool, a mutual
															fund can not deviate from its stated objectives at any point of
															time. Every Mutual Fund is managed by a fund manager, who using
															his investment management skills and necessary research works
															ensures much better return than what an investor can manage on
															his own. The capital appreciation and other incomes earned from
															these investments are passed on to the investors (also known as
															unit holders) in proportion of the number of units they own.</p>
														<p>When an investor subscribes for the units of a mutual fund, he
															becomes part owner of the assets of the fund in the same
															proportion as his contribution amount put up with the corpus
															(the total amount of the fund). Mutual Fund investor is also
															known as a mutual fund shareholder or a unit holder. Any change
															in the value of the investments made into capital market
															instruments (such as shares, debentures etc) is reflected in the
															Net Asset Value (NAV) of the scheme. NAV is defined as the
															market value of the Mutual Fund scheme’s assets net of its
															liabilities. NAV of a scheme is calculated by dividing the
															market value of scheme’s assets by the total number of units
															issued to the investors. For example:</p>
														<ul class="review-list">
															<li>If the market value of the assets of a fund is Rs 100,000
															</li>
															<li>The total number of units issued to the investors is equal
																to 10,000</li>
															<li>256 ReviewsThen the NAV of this scheme = (A)/(B) i.e.
																100,000/10,000 or 10.0</li>
															<li>Now if an investor ’X’ own 5 units of this scheme</li>
															<li>Then his total contribution to the fund is Rs. 50(i.e.
																Number of units held multiplied by the NAV of the scheme)
															</li>
														</ul>

														<h4>Financial Planning</h4>
														<p>Financial planning is a long-term process of wisely managing your
															finances so that you can achieve your goals and dreams. These
															goals may include</p>
	
														<ul class="review-list">
															<li>Buying a house</li>
															<li>Saving for your childs education</li>
															<li>Your daughters marriage</li>
															<li>Buying a car</li>
															<li>Eventually planning for retirement</li>
														</ul>
														<h3>How to Make Financial Planning Work for You?</h3>
														<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
															<li> <b> Set realistic goals </b>- Set realistic goals. Set
																specific
																targets of what you want to achieve and when you want to
																achieve results. Be quantitative wherever possible. You may
																dream of your goals but be in touch with ground reality. Not
																all can be a Rockefeller.</li>
															<li> <b> Understand Risk and Return </b>- Understand that there
																is no free lunch. Risk and return are interrelated. Set
																reasonable objectives. Do not expect high yield investments
																not to carry any additional risk, they usually do. Most
																people underestimate the stress of a high-risk plan on its
																way down. In most cases its better to be safe than sorry.
															</li>
															<li> <b> Review your Plans </b>- Once the plan has been
																implemented, it requires a periodic review. This is
																imperative to adjust the plan to the changing situation in
																ones life, financial situation and income levels.
															</li>
															<li> <b> Start Early in Life </b>- There is a myth that
																financial planning is for the elderly. The earlier you start
																financial planning the better of you will be in achieving
																your lifes goals. Its more advantageous to save small
																amounts of money at a younger age than to wait till one is
																much older to save large sums.
															</li>
															<li> <b> Execute the Plan on time </b>- Financial planning is a
																perishable commodity. What is available today may be gone
																tomorrow. Speed and timeliness of execution makes the
																difference between a millionaire and an average performer.
																If you have doubts about your ability to execute the plan in
																a timely.
															</li>

														<h4>Insurance</h4>
	
														<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
															<li> <b> INSURED </b>-A person or a corporation who contracts
																for an insurance policy that indemnifies (protects) him
																against loss or damage to property or, in the case of a
																liability policy, defend him against a claim from a third
																party.</li>
															<li> <b> NAMED INSURED </b>- Any person, firm or corporation
																specifically designated by name as an insured(s) in a policy
																as distinguished from others who, though unnamed, are
																protected under some circumstances. For example, a common
																application of this latter principle is in auto liability
																policies wherein by a definition of "insured", coverage is
																extended to other drivers using the car with the permission
																of the named insured. Other parties can also be afforded
																protection of an insurance policy by being named an
																"additional insured" in the policy or endorsement.
															</li>
															<li> <b> ADDITIONAL INSURED </b>- An individual or entity that
																is not automatically included as an insured under the policy
																of another, but for whom the named insureds policy provides
																a certain degree of protection. An endorsement is typically
																required to effect additional insured status. The named
																insureds impetus for providing additional insured status to
																others may be a desire to protect the other party because of
																a close relationship with that party (e.g., employees or
																members of an insured club) or to comply with a contractual
																agreement requiring the named insured to do so (e.g.,
																customers or owners of property leased by the named
																insured).
															</li>
															<li> <b> CO-INSURANCE </b>- The sharing of one insurance policy
																or risk between two or more insurance companies. This
																usually entails each insurer paying directly to the insured
																their respective share of the loss. Co-insurance can also be
																the arrangement by which the insured, in consideration of a
																reduced rate, agrees to carry an amount of insurance equal
																to a percentage of the total value of the property insured.
																An example is if you have guaranteed to carry insurance up
																to 80% or 90% of the value of your building and/or contents,
																whatever the case may be. If you dont, the company pays
																claims only in proportion to the amount of coverage you do
																carry.
															</li>
														</ul>
														<p>The following equation is used to determine what amount may be
															collected for partial loss:</p>
														<ul class="review-list">
															<li>Amount of Insurance Carried x Loss
															</li>
															<li>Amount of Insurance that = Payment</li>
															<li>Should be Carried</li>
															<li>Example A Mr. Right has an 80% co-insurance clause and the
																following situation:</li>
															<li>$100,000 building value
															</li>

														<h4>Taxation</h4>
														<p>Whats the most tax advantaged group in the tax code? The answer
															may surprise you, especially if youre a business owner. But the
															answer is simple - you, the business owner are POTENTIALLY the
															most tax advantaged group in the tax code. Believe it or not,
															business owners get all the breaks. And no, the tax breaks are
															not just for the Fortune 500 companies, but the middle market,
															small business, or family owned business all the same. I would
															add a caveat to make it a little more believable and accurate.
															The most advantaged group in the tax code is the INFORMED
															business owner. If you feel encumbered by the tax code and
															business laws, and dont see too many breaks coming your way, its
															because you fall into the unfortunate group called the
															UNINFORMED business owners!</p>
														<p>So, how do you become one of these favored informed business
															owners so you can start to see these benefits come your way? The
															answer is strategic tax planning. Or better yet, you need to
															find a professional that can provide you with comprehensive,
															strategic tax planning. To define it, let me first tell you what
															its NOT.</p>
														<h3>Strategic Tax Planning is NOT:</h3>
														<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
															<li>Tax Compliance - Tax compliance is a necessary evil.
																Preparing financial statements, filing tax returns, making
																estimated payments, and so on, is tax compliance. It is a
																very necessary service, but takes more dollars out of your
																pocket than what it puts into your pocket. I like to think
																of tax compliance as the scorekeeper of the football game.
																Keeping score as the game progresses. But if your team is
																losing big on any given Sunday - Do you get mad at the
																scorekeeper? No! And please dont get mad at your scorekeeper
																/ accountant, they are doing exactly what you pay them to
																do. Tax planning, on the other hand, is the coach that
																formulates the game plan and develops the strategies
																throughout the year. Are you and your business missing this
																planning function?</li>
															<li>The Big Three Tax Ideas - This is my nickname for three
																practices that sometimes give business owners a bad
																impression of tax planning. The Big Three are again NOT tax
																planning. The Big Three are:
															</li>
														</ul>
														<ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
															<li>Buying Equipment solely for the "write-off" - if you need
																the equipment great. Buying equipment in the most tax
																advantaged manner is wise, but I have seen too many garages
																and warehouses full of new, unused equipment. If the
																equipment is not going to make you money today, dont buy it.
																Does it make business sense to spend $100 to get a $30
																deduction? No! </li>
															<li>Paying yourself a bonus to pay your taxes. You are actually
																increasing your taxes (payroll and income) to pay the tax.
																Again the idea with tax planning is to REDUCE your tax.
															</li>
															<li>Writing off obsolete inventory - If you have obsolete
																inventory, great, write it off. But again, this is not tax
																planning.</li>
														</ul>
														<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
															<li>End of the Year Ideas - "Wow, Mr. or Ms. Business Owner,
																youve had a great year or worse yet great last year - you
																owe a lot of tax." "What Can I do?" "Well you made money so
																you will simply have to pay a lot of tax!" If this sounds
																familiar you know this is not tax planning. Tax planning
																cannot simply be performed at the end of the year or the
																beginning of the next year. Regardless of when the taxes are
																actually filed, the facts that determine how much tax you
																pay are history at that point. </li>
															<li>Showing Zero Income - Tax planning is not a matter of the
																questionable and risky process of wiping out the income "on
																the books" to pay no tax. This practice severely reduces the
																value of your business, your ability to get financing
																without personal guarantees, and your ability to get
																bonding. The big companies do tax planning while showing a
																profit and providing shareholder value and return. They need
																to show the biggest profit possible while reducing one of
																their biggest expenses - taxes. </li>
															<li>Im Getting a Refund - Please, once and for all, getting a
																refund is not a good thing. It doesnt mean you didnt pay tax
																- it means you gave the government an interest free loan.
																And since the government is unlikely to give you an interest
																free loan, dont give one to them. You need to look at the
																payroll and income taxes that you and your business are
																paying. For cash flow purposes, you want to pay your taxes
																timely, but as late in the game as possible.</li>
														</ul>
														<h3>What Strategic Tax Planning IS:</h3>
														<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
															<li>Entity Structure Planning - Create the optimal entity
																structure for your business and you personally to maximize
																your tax benefits and legal asset protection benefits. </li>
															<li>Compensation and Benefit Planning - Develop strategies that
																meet your personal and business short and long goals and
																objectives. Its really about minimizing taxes and out of
																pocket expenses paid with after tax dollars. The goal is
																maximize your income and the amount available to the
																business by minimizing your taxes across the board
															</li>
															<li>Maximize Advanced Retirement Planning and Income Deferral
																Opportunities - Business owners must annually capitalize on
																techniques to maximize monies and continued income streams
																available for life after the business. </li>
															<li>Utilize Succession, Exit Strategy, and Estate Planning
																Opportunities - Remember, when you exit your business, it
																will be a taxable event. Develop a plan to minimize taxes on
																the transfer to ensure you walk away with as much money as
																possible. </li>
															<li>Avoid or Eliminate Questionable or "Grey Area" Tax Planning
																Strategies to reduce Audit Risk - All your tax planning
																strategies should be supported by the black and white
																language of the IRS Tax Code and Regulations. For the
																informed business owner many opportunities exist.</li>
														</ul>
														<h3>Think About It..... The Need for Tax Planning!</h3>
														<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
															<li>Your business is an S-Corporation to avoid corporate level
																tax. The business earns $100.00. To put that in your pocket,
																you must pay employee and employer level payroll tax-15.3%.
																Your remaining $85.00 is then subject to your personal tax
																rate-35%. You now have $55.00 in your pocket. Do you dare
																spend it and reduce it further with sales tax? No, you
																decide to save it. If you die with that $55.00 in your
																pocket, the estate tax can tax an additional 45% from you
																and your surviving family members. You now pass on $30.00 to
																your family after passing $70.00 to the government in the
																form of taxes.</li>

														<h4>NRI Corner</h4>
	
														<h3>Who is a Non-Resident Indian (NRI)?</h3>
														<p>A non-resident Indian (NRI) is an Indian citizen or a person of
															Indian origin who stays abroad for employment, business or
															vocation outside India, or stays abroad under circumstances
															indicating an uncertain duration.</p>
														<h3>Who is a Person of Indian Origin (PIO)?</h3>
														<p>A Person of Indian Origin means a citizen of any country (other
															than Bangladesh or Pakistan), if the person: (a) at any time
															held an Indian passport; or (b) or the persons parents or
															grandparents were citizens of India; or (c) is a spouse of an
															Indian citizen, or of a person referred to in (a) or (b) above.
														</p>
														<p>Other terms with vaguely the same meaning are overseas Indian and
															expatriate Indian. In common usage, this often includes
															Indian-born individuals (and also people of other nations with
															Indian ancestry) who have taken the citizenship of other
															countries.</p>
														<p>According to Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs, India has the
															second largest diaspora in the world after Overseas Chinese .
															The overseas Indian community estimated at over 25 million is
															spread across every major region in the world.</p>
														<h3>Who is a Foreign Institutional Investor (FII)?</h3>
														<p>An FII is an institution established or incorporated outside
															India which proposes to invest in Indian securities and is
															registered with SEBI.</p>
														<h3>Who is an Overseas Corporate Body (OCB) ?</h3>
														<p>An OCB includes overseas companies, partnership firms, societies
															and other corporate bodies owned predominantly by non-resident
															persons of Indian nationality or origin outside India.</p>
														<h3>Can an NRI maintain a bank account in India?</h3>
														<p>Yes. NRIs can maintain accounts in rupees as well as in foreign
															currency.</p>
														<h3>What types of rupee accounts may NRIs maintain?</h3>
														<b>There are 4 types:</b>
														<ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
															<li>Non-resident (External) Rupee Accounts (NRE)</li>
															<li>Non-Resident (Special) Rupee (NRSR) Account
															</li>
															<li>Ordinary Non-resident Rupee Accounts (NRO)</li>
															<li>Non-resident (Non-repatriable) Rupee deposit accounts (NRNR)
															</li>
														</ul>
														<h3>What are NRE, NRO and FCNR accounts?</h3>
														<p>Non-Resident (External) Rupee (NRE). This is a Rupee account from
															which funds are freely repatriable. It can be opened with either
															funds remitted from abroad or local funds which can be remitted
															abroad.</p>
														<p>Non-Resident Ordinary Rupee (NRO). This is a Rupee account and
															can be opened with funds either remitted from abroad or
															generated in India. These funds are non-repatriable. However,
															under certain circumstances, these are allowed to be
															repatriated.</p>
														<p>Fully Convertible Non-Resident Rupee (FCNR). This account is
															similar to the NRE account except that the funds are held in
															foreign currencies and can be maintained in Pound Sterling,U.S.
															Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen. FCNR accounts can be maintained
															only in the form of term deposits, i.e. a deposit kept for fixed
															periods ranging from 6 months to 3 years.
														</p>
														<h3>How do NRE, NRO and NRSR accounts differ?</h3>
														<p>Balances held in NRE accounts can be repatriated abroad freely,
															whereas funds in NRSR and NRO account cannot be normally
															remitted abroad but have to be used only for local payments in
															rupees. Consequently, funds remitted from abroad or local funds
															which can otherwise be remitted abroad to the accountholder can
															only be credited to NRE accounts</p>
